# Different Cryptographic Functions implemented in R
### Francesco Pinto, University of Helsinki 2022

These function have been developed to do the Cryptography course's exam in October 2022, then I decided to share them. \
The implemented functions are: \
-**AFFINE Cipher**: to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with AFFINE Cipher \
-**Linear Feedback Shift Register**: function that, given the length of the LFSR and the position of the taps, evaluate all the different states of the LFSR \
-**Points of an Elliptic Curve finder**: the function takes in input the polynomial of the Elliptic Curve and the field $Z_x$ and computes all the points of the curve.
